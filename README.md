# Pomodoro Timer :tomato:
<br>
Initially, I thought creating a Tic Tac Toe app would be straightforward after completing a React Calculator. However, I was mistaken. The complexity increased when I decided to implement a computer player. During the project, I had a breakthrough in working with reducers, simplifying functions, and utilizing booleans as state toggles. It was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided insights into state management. I'm proud of the progress made and the lessons learned.

## User Stories
&check;  I can set varied session and break lengths.

&check;  I can pause and reset sessions and breaks.

&check;  I can hear an audio alert when it is time to start my break or resume work.

&check;  I can see a tally of how many breaks/sessions I have completed.

## Lessons Learned
- Simplifying state management with a reducer

- Using setInterval within a useEffect

- Refactoring a reducer into TypeScript with an interface

## Getting Started

1.  cd vite-project
2.  npm install
3.  npm run dev
4.  Go to http://localhost:5173/
