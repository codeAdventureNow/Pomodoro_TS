# Pomodoro Timer
<br>
During this project, I experienced a significant breakthrough in my understanding of state management. One of the challenges I faced was implementing a countdown clock, which required some creative problem-solving. Once I overcame that obstacle, the project progressed smoothly. As an additional self-imposed challenge, I incorporated a feature where the UI of the timer would dynamically toggle colors based on whether the user was in a 'session' or 'break' mode.
The project was later refactored to have the state managed by a reducer and then refactored once more into TypeScript. 

## User Stories
&check; - I can set varied session and break lengths.

&check; - I can pause and reset sessions and breaks.

&check; - I can hear an audio alert when it is time to start my break or resume work.

&check; - I can see a tally of how many breaks/sessions I have completed.

## Lessons Learned
1. Simplifying state management with a reducer

2. Using setInterval within a useEffect

3. Refactoring a reducer into TypeScript with an interface
