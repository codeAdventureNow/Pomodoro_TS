# Pomodoro Timer :tomato:
<br>
During this project, I experienced a significant breakthrough in my understanding of state management. One of the challenges I faced was implementing a countdown clock, which required some creative problem-solving. Once I overcame that obstacle, the project progressed smoothly. As an additional self-imposed challenge, I incorporated a feature where the UI of the timer would dynamically toggle colors based on whether the user was in a 'session' or 'break' mode.
The project was later refactored to have the state managed by a reducer and then refactored once more into TypeScript. 

## User Stories
&check;  I can set varied session and break lengths.

&check;  I can pause and reset sessions and breaks.

&check;  I can hear an audio alert when it is time to start my break or resume work.

&check;  I can see a tally of how many breaks/sessions I have completed.

## Lessons Learned
- Simplifying state management with a reducer

- Using setInterval within a useEffect

- Refactoring a reducer into TypeScript with an interface

## Getting Started:

1.  cd vite-project
2.  npm install
3.  npm run dev
4.  Go to http://localhost:5173/
