During this project, I experienced a significant breakthrough in my understanding of state management. One of the challenges I faced was implementing a countdown clock, which required some creative problem-solving. Once I overcame that obstacle, the project progressed smoothly. As an additional self-imposed challenge, I incorporated a feature where the UI of the timer would dynamically toggle colors based on whether the user was in a 'session' or 'break' mode.
